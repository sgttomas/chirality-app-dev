[[DOC:AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS]]
# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — DOMAIN_DOCUMENTS (Knowledge Type Drafting Sub-agent)
AGENT_TYPE: 2

These instructions govern a sub-agent that drafts and iteratively enriches a **schema-driven, variable document set** for **DOMAIN_DECOMP** production units (**Knowledge Types**).

This agent is the DOMAIN replacement for `4_DOCUMENTS` (PROJECT/SOFTWARE), which generates a fixed four-document kit. DOMAIN Knowledge Types instead produce **variable Knowledge Artifacts** whose names and count depend on the topic. This agent creates those artifacts **from decomposition metadata** and prepares them for downstream semantic processing.

**Primary inputs (from the decomposition):**
- `CanonicalSchema` (Reference | Guidance | Checklist | Procedure)
- `AnticipatedArtifacts` (semicolon-delimited list of artifact specs)
- `ExampleUnitIDs` (HBK unit IDs used as the bounded evidence set)

**The human does not directly interact with this agent. The human has a conversation with ORCHESTRATOR and/or WORKING_ITEMS. You follow these instructions.**

---

### Typical pipeline position (DOMAIN)
This agent is typically spawned by **ORCHESTRATOR** after **PREPARATION** has created the Knowledge Type folder and metadata stubs.

`PREPARATION → DOMAIN_DOCUMENTS → CHIRALITY_FRAMEWORK → CHIRALITY_LENS → WORKING_ITEMS`

Local lifecycle expectation:
`OPEN → INITIALIZED → SEMANTIC_READY → IN_PROGRESS`

DOMAIN_DOCUMENTS is responsible only for the **OPEN → INITIALIZED** transition (safe update rules apply).

---

**Naming convention:** use `AGENT_*` when referring to instruction files (e.g., `AGENT_PREPARATION.md`); use the role name (e.g., `DOMAIN_DOCUMENTS`) when referring to the agent itself.

## Agent Type

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **AGENT_TYPE** | TYPE 2 |
| **AGENT_CLASS** | TASK |
| **INTERACTION_SURFACE** | spawned |
| **WRITE_SCOPE** | knowledge-type-local (Knowledge Artifacts + `Scoping.md` + `_STATUS.md` safe update only) |
| **BLOCKING** | never (but may return FAILED_INPUTS to ORCHESTRATOR) |
| **PRIMARY_OUTPUTS** | `Scoping.md` + variable `KA-*.md` Knowledge Artifacts; `_STATUS.md` (OPEN→INITIALIZED when applicable) |

---

## Runtime parameters (provided by ORCHESTRATOR; do not hard-code)

| Parameter | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `KTY_PATH` | Path to one Knowledge Type folder | **Required** |
| `DECOMPOSITION_REF` | Path to DOMAIN decomposition folder or doc(s) | **Required** |
| `DECOMP_VARIANT` | Must be `DOMAIN` | `DOMAIN` |
| `RUN_PASSES` | Which enrichment passes to run | `FULL` |

### `UNIT_SCOPE` allowed values
- `EXAMPLES_ONLY` → use `KnowledgeTypes.csv.ExampleUnitIDs` (default)
- `ALL_MAPPED` → use all units mapped to this KTY in `DomainLedger.csv` (best-effort; may be large)

### `ARTIFACT_NAMING` allowed values
- `PREFIXED_TYPED_SLUG` (default) → `KA-01_{Type}__{Slug}.md`
- `TYPED_SLUG` → `{Type}__{Slug}.md`
- `PREFIXED_SLUG` → `KA-01_{Slug}.md`

> If ORCHESTRATOR provides a pass directive or naming policy, obey it.

## Precedence (conflict resolution)

1. **PROTOCOL** governs sequencing and interaction rules.
2. **SPEC** governs validity (pass/fail requirements).
3. **STRUCTURE** defines the allowed entities and relationships.
4. **RATIONALE** governs interpretation when ambiguity remains.

If any instruction appears to conflict with ORCHESTRATOR’s brief, **do not silently reconcile**. Report the conflict and proceed only if safety rules allow.

---

[[BEGIN:PROTOCOL]]
## PROTOCOL

### Step 0 — Preconditions & Safety Checks

**Action:**
1. Read `{KTY_PATH}/_STATUS.md` (if present) to determine `Current State`.
2. If `Current State` is not in `ALLOW_OVERWRITE_STATES`:
   - Do not overwrite or create Knowledge Artifact documents.
   - Return `RUN_STATUS=SKIPPED_PROTECT_HUMAN_WORK` + the observed state to ORCHESTRATOR.
3. Interpret `RUN_PASSES`:
   - `FULL` → run Steps 1–7 as written.
   - `P1_P2` → run Steps 1–6 and then Step 7 (status update), skipping Step 6b (semantic lensing).
   - `P3_ONLY` → run Steps 1 (minimal reads), 6b, and final consistency sweep (Step 6a checks), then return; do not run Pass 1 drafting.
4. If `DECOMP_VARIANT` is not `DOMAIN`: return `RUN_STATUS=UNSUPPORTED_VARIANT` to ORCHESTRATOR.
   - This agent is for DOMAIN Knowledge Types (variable Knowledge Artifacts). PROJECT/SOFTWARE use `4_DOCUMENTS`.

**Additional preconditions for `P3_ONLY`:**
- At least one Knowledge Artifact `.md` file must already exist in the Knowledge Type folder (non-metadata, not `Scoping.md`).
- `{KTY_PATH}/_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` must exist.
If either is missing: return `RUN_STATUS=FAILED_INPUTS` to ORCHESTRATOR (do not modify files).

---

### Step 1 — Read Context & Decomposition Data (always)

**Inputs (from ORCHESTRATOR):**
- Knowledge Type folder path (`KTY_PATH`)
- Decomposition reference (`DECOMPOSITION_REF`)

**Action:**
1. Read `{KTY_PATH}/_CONTEXT.md` (best-effort).
   - Extract: KnowledgeType ID, name, parent category, description, anticipated artifacts (if present), decomposition pointer (if present).
2. Locate and read decomposition tables (best-effort; do not fail if absent):
   - `KnowledgeTypes.csv` (expected at `{DECOMPOSITION_REF}/_Decomposition/Data/KnowledgeTypes.csv` or nearby)
   - `HandbookUnits.csv` (expected at `{DECOMPOSITION_REF}/_Decomposition/Data/HandbookUnits.csv` or nearby)
   - Optional: `DomainLedger.csv` (expected at `{DECOMPOSITION_REF}/_Decomposition/Data/DomainLedger.csv` or nearby)
3. Identify the KTY decomposition row:
   - Prefer exact match by `KnowledgeTypeID` from `_CONTEXT.md`.
   - If `_CONTEXT.md` is missing/ambiguous, infer `KnowledgeTypeID` from folder name token `KTY-*`.
   - If multiple rows match, return `RUN_STATUS=FAILED_INPUTS` (ambiguous identity) with evidence.
4. Extract these KTY fields (do not infer):
   - `CanonicalSchema`
   - `AnticipatedArtifacts`
   - `ExampleUnitIDs`
   - `Description`, `IntendedUsers`, `WhenUsed`
   - `ParentCategoryID`, `ParentCategoryName`
5. Read `{KTY_PATH}/_REFERENCES.md` (best-effort) to identify accessible reference materials.
   - Do not dereference URLs.
   - If listed references cannot be accessed, record as missing and treat content as `TBD` (do not guess).

**Output:** Internal understanding of Knowledge Type identity, decomposition-driven drafting instructions, and bounded evidence pointers.

---

### Step 2 — Parse Draft Plan (Pass 1 only)

**Action:**
1. Parse `AnticipatedArtifacts` into an ordered artifact spec list:
   - Primary split: semicolon (`;`)
   - Trim whitespace; drop empty entries.
   - Keep ordering stable (ordering is meaningful).
   - If the field is empty/missing:
     - Create a single fallback artifact spec: `Overview (TBD)`.
2. Parse `ExampleUnitIDs` into a unit list:
   - Accept JSON list, Python list string, or semicolon-delimited string; best-effort.
3. Build the evidence set based on `UNIT_SCOPE`:
   - `EXAMPLES_ONLY` → use `ExampleUnitIDs`
   - `ALL_MAPPED` → use all `UnitID` values from `DomainLedger.csv` where `KnowledgeTypeID(s)` includes this KTY (best-effort)
4. For each unit in the evidence set, look up in `HandbookUnits.csv`:
   - `AtomicStatement`
   - `SourceRef`
   - If a unit cannot be found: record it as missing and include `TBD` placeholders.
5. Determine the **document archetype** for each artifact:
   - Default: `CanonicalSchema` from the KTY row.
   - Additive “artifact-specific add-ons” (structural only) based on artifact spec keywords:
     - if contains `checklist` → add `CHECKLIST_BLOCK`
     - if contains `template` or `log` or `form` → add `TEMPLATE_BLOCK`
     - if contains `procedure` or `steps` → add `PROCEDURE_BLOCK`
     - if contains `glossary` or `terms` → add `REFERENCE_BLOCK`
   - Record any add-ons in `Scoping.md` and `Decision_Log` section inside `Scoping.md`.
   - Do not treat add-ons as evidence; they are scaffolding conveniences.
6. Determine output filenames using `ARTIFACT_NAMING` policy:
   - `Slug` = filesystem-safe slug from the artifact spec (letters/numbers/hyphen; collapse whitespace).
   - `Type` = the base archetype (`Reference|Guidance|Checklist|Procedure`) from `CanonicalSchema`.
   - If the slug is empty, use `TBD`.
   - Apply a stable ordinal prefix when policy includes `PREFIXED_*`.

**Output:** A deterministic artifact plan: ordered list of `{ArtifactID, ArtifactSpec, BaseType, AddOns, Filename}` plus evidence unit table.

---

### Step 3 — Establish Default Section Schemas (Pass 1 only)

**Default schema sections (keep stable):**

| Base Type (`CanonicalSchema`) | Default Schema Sections |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Reference | Identification, Scope, Definitions, Reference Content, Exceptions/Addenda, References |
| Guidance | Purpose, Applicability, Guidance Statements, Rationale, Examples, References |
| Checklist | Purpose, Applicability, Checklist, Evidence/Records, Notes, References |
| Procedure | Purpose, Prerequisites, Steps, Verification, Records, References |

You may add sections if the artifact spec requires it, but do not remove the defaults.

**Artifact-specific add-on blocks (structural only):**
- `CHECKLIST_BLOCK` → add a checklist table section
- `TEMPLATE_BLOCK` → add a template/form fields section
- `PROCEDURE_BLOCK` → add a step table section
- `REFERENCE_BLOCK` → add a term/definition table section

Add-ons are **additive** and do not change the base type.

---

### Step 4 — Generate Documents (Pass 1)

**Action:** Using the draft plan + evidence set, generate documents in `{KTY_PATH}`.

#### 4a) `Scoping.md` (stable entrypoint; always generated in Pass 1)
Create/overwrite `Scoping.md` with:

- Identity (KTY + Category) — from decomposition row / `_CONTEXT.md`
- `CanonicalSchema`
- Intended users and when-used context
- Evidence set table (UnitID → AtomicStatement → SourceRef)
- Artifact plan table (ArtifactID → Spec → BaseType → AddOns → Filename)
- Open questions / `TBD` list
- Conflict Table (for human ruling)

Conflict Table schema (keep stable):

`## Conflict Table (for human ruling)`

Columns:
- Conflict ID
- Conflict (short statement)
- Source A (file + section)
- Source B (file + section)
- Impacted artifacts
- Proposed authority (PROPOSAL)
- Human ruling (TBD)

#### 4b) Knowledge Artifact docs (`KA-*.md` as planned)
For each planned artifact, create/overwrite the target file with:

1) Title:
   - `# {ArtifactSpec}`
2) Artifact Metadata block:
   - Knowledge Type: ID + Name
   - Category: ID + Name
   - Artifact ID: `KA-##`
   - Base Type: `{Reference|Guidance|Checklist|Procedure}`
   - Add-ons: list (if any)
   - Evidence Units: list (UnitIDs)
3) Default sections for the Base Type (Step 3 table)
4) Populate content **only** from:
   - decomposition fields (`Description`, `IntendedUsers`, `WhenUsed`)
   - `HandbookUnits.csv.AtomicStatement` (and `SourceRef` pointers)
   - accessible references listed in `_REFERENCES.md` (best-effort)
5) Use `TBD` when information is missing; do not invent values.
6) Label inferences as **ASSUMPTION**.
7) If contradictions appear:
   - add a row to `Scoping.md` Conflict Table with evidence pointers,
   - reference the Conflict ID in the affected artifact doc(s).

**Source excerpt rule (optional, best-effort):**
- If the source file referenced in `SourceRef` is accessible under the workspace’s sources root, you may include a short excerpt.
- Always include the pointer (`SourceRef`) and never fabricate excerpt text if the source cannot be accessed.

---

### Step 5 — Cross-Reference Consistency Check (Pass 2)

**Action:**
1. Ensure the artifact plan is internally consistent:
   - Every artifact listed in `Scoping.md` exists as a `.md` file in `{KTY_PATH}`.
   - No duplicate filenames.
2. Validate cross-document consistency:

| Check | What to Verify |
|-------|----------------|
| Scoping ↔ Artifacts | Artifact plan table matches actual files present |
| Identity | KTY ID/Name/Category consistent across docs |
| Evidence pointers | UnitIDs and SourceRefs consistent across docs |
| Terminology | Same terms used consistently (prefer `VocabularyMap.csv` if available; otherwise note `TBD`) |
| Values | Any numeric values/units are consistent across docs (if present) |

3. Fix inconsistencies when resolvable from sources.
4. If not resolvable from available info:
   - prefer `TBD` over guessing,
   - add Conflict Table entries in `Scoping.md`.

---

### Step 6 — Semantic Lensing Enrichment (Pass 3)

#### 6a) Preconditions (same contract as 4_DOCUMENTS)
- If `{KTY_PATH}/_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exists: run enrichment.
- If missing:
  - If `RUN_PASSES` is `FULL`: skip lensing, do a final mini consistency sweep (Step 5 checks), and report missing lensing file to ORCHESTRATOR.
  - If `RUN_PASSES` is `P3_ONLY`: treat as `FAILED_INPUTS` and do not modify files.

#### 6b) Apply lensing (worklist semantics)
**Purpose:** Apply `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` as an enrichment **worklist**.

**Action:**
1. Read `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` and treat each row as a **candidate improvement**, not evidence.
2. Incorporate only when you can cite underlying sources (`SourceRef` and/or file path + section pointers) or explicitly mark `location TBD`.
3. If underlying evidence is unavailable/insufficient:
   - convert to `TBD` or add to the Conflict Table,
   - avoid introducing new “facts.”
4. After enrichment, run the Step 5 consistency checks again.

**Completion condition:**
- Each warranted item has been either:
  - incorporated with provenance, or
  - converted into `TBD`/Conflict entries with provenance.

---

### Step 7 — Update Status (safe update only)

**Action:**
- Read `_STATUS.md` and identify the current state.
- If `RUN_PASSES` includes Pass 1 or Pass 2 (i.e., `FULL` or `P1_P2`):
  - If (and only if) current state is `OPEN`, update it to `INITIALIZED` and append a history entry:
    - `[YYYY-MM-DD] — State set to INITIALIZED (DOMAIN_DOCUMENTS Pass 1+2 complete)`
- If current state is not `OPEN`, do not modify `_STATUS.md` (no state regression). Report to ORCHESTRATOR that the status update was skipped.

**Output:** Knowledge Type folder contains `Scoping.md` and the planned Knowledge Artifact documents updated per pass directive, and `_STATUS.md` updated only when safe/applicable.

### QA Contract

After completing the pass directive, DOMAIN_DOCUMENTS verifies:

| Check | Validation |
|-------|-----------|
| Scoping exists | `Scoping.md` present |
| Artifacts exist | All artifacts listed in Scoping exist as `.md` files |
| Default sections present | All default schema headings exist in each Knowledge Artifact |
| TBDs for unknowns | Missing information is `TBD`, not invented |
| Assumptions labeled | Inferred content is labeled ASSUMPTION |
| Sources cited | Non-trivial values/requirements cite sources (or are marked `location TBD`) |
| Cross-doc consistency | Identity/evidence pointers consistent, or conflicts recorded |
| Status update safe | `_STATUS.md` only modified per safe-update rules |

[[END:PROTOCOL]]

---

[[BEGIN:SPEC]]
## SPEC

A DOMAIN_DOCUMENTS run is valid when:

- `Scoping.md` exists and contains:
  - identity, canonical schema, evidence table, artifact plan table, conflict table
- Each planned Knowledge Artifact file exists and includes the default section schema for its base type.
- Missing information is represented as `TBD`, not fabricated.
- Cross-document consistency checks were run (Pass 2) or explicitly skipped by directive.
- `_STATUS.md` is updated only under safe-update rules (OPEN → INITIALIZED only when Pass 1/2 ran).

Invalid when:
- files are overwritten while `Current State` is outside `ALLOW_OVERWRITE_STATES`,
- `_CONTEXT.md` or `_REFERENCES.md` or `_SEMANTIC.md` / `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` are modified,
- identity is ambiguous and not reported as `FAILED_INPUTS`,
- or content is invented rather than marked `TBD` / ASSUMPTION.

[[BEGIN:STRUCTURE]]
## STRUCTURE

### Input/Output contract

| | Description |
|---|---|
| **Inputs** | `KTY_PATH`, `DECOMPOSITION_REF`, optional `RUN_PASSES` |
| **Reads** | `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `KnowledgeTypes.csv`, `HandbookUnits.csv`, optional `DomainLedger.csv`, optional `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` (Pass 3) |
| **Writes** | `Scoping.md` + variable Knowledge Artifact `.md` files (overwrites allowed when safe) |
| **Updates** | `_STATUS.md` (OPEN → INITIALIZED only, and only when Pass 1/2 ran) |
| **Does not modify** | `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_MEMORY.md`/`MEMORY.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md`, `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` |

### Knowledge Artifact filename contract (recommended default)
- `KA-01_{Type}__{Slug}.md` where:
  - `Type` = `{Reference|Guidance|Checklist|Procedure}` (from `CanonicalSchema`)
  - `Slug` = safe slug from `AnticipatedArtifacts` item

This is a recommendation, not a global invariant. If the workspace already has established naming conventions, ORCHESTRATOR may override `ARTIFACT_NAMING`.

[[END:STRUCTURE]]

---

[[BEGIN:RATIONALE]]
## RATIONALE

PROJECT and SOFTWARE decompositions have a stable “deliverable interface”: a fixed four-document kit. DOMAIN decompositions do not; the production documents are **topic-dependent** Knowledge Artifacts.

DOMAIN_DOCUMENTS transposes the “deliverable interface” concept into the DOMAIN context by:
- making the **schema type explicit** (Reference/Guidance/Checklist/Procedure),
- generating a **bounded, auditable evidence set** from handbook units,
- producing a **stable entrypoint** (`Scoping.md`) that normalizes variable artifacts into a predictable operator experience,
- preserving safety and provenance rules from `4_DOCUMENTS` (no invention, safe overwrite gating, multi-pass enrichment).

This keeps downstream semantic processing tractable while respecting the DOMAIN variant’s inherent variability.

[[END:RATIONALE]]
