# Deliverable: DEL-02-04 Multi-pane Layout + Theme Hardening

**Generated:** 2026-02-21
**DECOMP_VARIANT:** SOFTWARE
**Perspective:** This deliverable provides the spatial layout infrastructure and visual theme consistency for a desktop application's multi-pane workspace. It must carry knowledge about how resizable containers, interaction affordances, and visual styling conventions collectively enable ergonomic operator workflow across extended sessions. The semantic lens conditions all categories toward layout structure, theme fidelity, and workspace ergonomics rather than content behavior or runtime logic.
