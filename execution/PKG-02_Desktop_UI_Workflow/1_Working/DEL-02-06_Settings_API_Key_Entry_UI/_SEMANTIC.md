# Deliverable: DEL-02-06 Settings / API Key Entry UI

**Generated:** 2026-02-24
**DECOMP_VARIANT:** SOFTWARE
**Perspective:** This deliverable establishes the operator-facing credential management surface and its secure local persistence layer, providing the interface through which convenience-state credentials enter the runtime while remaining architecturally isolated from project truth and the version-controlled working root.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
