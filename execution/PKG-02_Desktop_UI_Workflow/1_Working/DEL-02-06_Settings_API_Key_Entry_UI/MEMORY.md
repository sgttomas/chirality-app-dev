# Working Memory — DEL-02-06

*This file is shared working memory for WORKING_ITEMS and TASK agents operating on this deliverable.*

## Key Decisions

- 2026-02-24: Deliverable created by SCA-003 to implement UI-based API key entry and non-project-truth local secure storage.
- Runtime contract: UI-provided key takes precedence; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` remains fallback.

## Open Questions

- None yet.

## Notes

- Awaiting 4_DOCUMENTS and implementation passes.
