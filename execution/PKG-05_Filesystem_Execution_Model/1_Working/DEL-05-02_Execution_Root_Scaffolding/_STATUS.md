|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | WS-2 continuity/decision follow-through pass completed: CON-03 baseline boundary resolved (DEL-05-02 test-level conformance retained; DEL-08-03 deferred while SOW-034 is `TBD` and PKG-08 non-driving), deliverable docs/evidence refreshed, and dependency posture confirmed unchanged. |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Non-code rulings harmonization pass completed: REQ-08 elevated to MUST, REQ-12 fail-fast diagnostics contract codified, INIT minimum schema documented, `_Sources` sub-structure ruling closed, and conflicting SHOULD/MUST wording aligned across deliverable docs. |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | REQ-12 fail-fast diagnostics pass landed: scaffolding now reports stage/path/partial-create context on filesystem conflicts and route-level error payloads preserve retry guidance; verification passed (`npm test` 70 tests, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Integration follow-through landed: scaffold trigger wiring is now exposed in PIPELINE PREP, scaffold results now include PREPARATION compatibility validation, and verification passed (`npm test` 60 tests, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | DEPENDENCIES/RECONCILIATION | Tier 1 fan-in checks completed: dependency register refreshed with SCA-001 execution-surface gates (`DEP-05-02-014/015` now `SATISFIED`), reconciliation snapshot recorded, and verification rerun passed (`npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | DEL-05-02 implementation pass landed in `frontend/`: added sanitize + scaffolding modules, `/api/harness/scaffold` route, and unit/integration/route tests; verification passed (`npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`). |
