- Periodic full-scope closure rerun completed at `execution/_Reconciliation/DepClosure/CLOSURE_AUDIT_DEP_CLOSURE_2026-02-23_0041/` and promoted to official pointer state (`_LATEST.md` updated). Delta vs prior full-scope snapshot (`2026-02-22_2123`): no metric change (`BLOCKER` unchanged; edges/SCC/orphan/isolated/bidirectional counts unchanged).
- Data-quality caveat for `DEL-01-01` is resolved: `DEP-01-01-010/011` now parse with aligned v3.1 fields (`Status=ACTIVE`, explanatory text in `Notes`) and are included in blocker-subset analysis.

### Pre-Tier Gate Wave Sequencing (SCA-001 policy overlay)

| Wave | Deliverables | Internal blocker edges (subset rule) | Current status |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| 0a | `DEL-01-03` | None | `IN_PROGRESS` |
| 0b | `DEL-03-07` | `DEL-01-03` (`DEP-03-07-004`, PREREQUISITE) | `IN_PROGRESS` |
| 0c | `DEL-02-05`, `DEL-07-03` | `DEL-01-03` + `DEL-03-07` (`DEP-0205-004/005`, `DEP-07-03-006/007`) | `IN_PROGRESS`, `IN_PROGRESS` |

Execution order: `DEL-01-03` -> `DEL-03-07` -> (`DEL-02-05`, `DEL-07-03` in parallel).

### Tier 2 Upstream Snapshot (Blocker subset + policy overlay)

| DEL-ID | Blocker-subset upstream edges (ACTIVE UPSTREAM PREREQUISITE/CONSTRAINT) | Policy overlay |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|
| DEL-01-01 | `DEL-05-01` (`DEP-01-01-007`, CONSTRAINT, met at `IN_PROGRESS`), `DEL-01-03` (`DEP-01-01-010`, PREREQUISITE), `DEL-03-07` (`DEP-01-01-011`, PREREQUISITE) | SCA-001 pre-tier gate met; eligible for queued execution |
| DEL-03-01 | `DEL-05-01` (`DEP-03-01-008`, CONSTRAINT), `DEL-01-03` (`DEP-03-01-016`, CONSTRAINT), `DEL-03-07` (`DEP-03-01-015`, PREREQUISITE) | SCA-001 pre-tier gate met; eligible for queued execution |
| DEL-05-03 | `DEL-05-02` (`DEP-05-03-006`, PREREQUISITE), `DEL-01-03` (`DEP-05-03-015`, PREREQUISITE), `DEL-03-07` (`DEP-05-03-016`, CONSTRAINT) | SCA-001 pre-tier gate met; eligible for queued execution |
| DEL-05-04 | `DEL-05-02` (`DEP-05-04-003`, PREREQUISITE), `DEL-01-03` (`DEP-05-04-011`, PREREQUISITE), `DEL-03-07` (`DEP-05-04-012`, CONSTRAINT) | SCA-001 pre-tier gate met; eligible for queued execution |
| DEL-06-02 | `DEL-06-01` (`DEP-06-02-006`, PREREQUISITE, met at `ISSUED`) | Not pre-tier-gated |

### Tier 2 Findings Snapshot (Pass 14 follow-through checkpoint)

| DEL-ID | Kickoff finding | Immediate focus |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| DEL-01-01 | Packaging evidence and arm64 artifact checks were re-run successfully in this repo (`desktop:pack`, `desktop:dist`). DEPENDENCIES normalization pass corrected `DEP-01-01-010/011` CSV field alignment and closure pointers were refreshed. REQ-BUILD-006 follow-through now hardens `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` in build/dev scripts with regression coverage for telemetry/auto-updater drift. | Continue Tier 2 integration consumers; keep DEL-01-01 upstream gating edges (`DEP-01-01-010/011`) tracked in blocker-subset sequencing and rerun network-policy regression checks when build scripts/entrypoints change. |
| DEL-03-01 | REQ-11 regression coverage and boot-time root/persona checks are implemented in route/runtime code, and pass13 now propagates this taxonomy into section8/premerge validation surfaces. | Maintain taxonomy coverage as new failure codes are introduced; keep section8 + premerge required-id lists synchronized. |
| DEL-05-03 | Lifecycle module + route-level API integration are now present under `frontend/src/lib/lifecycle/*` and `frontend/src/app/api/working-root/deliverable/status*`; WORKBENCH now consumes lifecycle transitions with role gating. | Keep transition-capable surfaces aligned through shared helpers (`canAgentTransitionLifecycle`, `requiresApprovalShaForTarget`, `nextLifecycleTargets`) so approval-evidence policy does not drift. |
| DEL-05-04 | Dependency contract module + deliverable API integration are now present under `frontend/src/lib/dependencies/*` and `frontend/src/app/api/working-root/deliverable/dependencies`; runtime consumer reporting now aligns to canonical blocker-subset policy. | Shared lifecycle-target helper (`requiresApprovalShaForTarget`) is now active in PIPELINE; keep helper reuse and periodic closure reruns aligned as additional surfaces are introduced. |
| DEL-06-02 | Workflow-agent conformance posture remains documentation-driven and local to this repo; REQ-16 is codified as completion-status observability, CT-001 is resolved, CT-002 is resolved via Option B, and lifecycle is now `ISSUED`. | No blocking follow-through remains for baseline scope; optional governance-level propagation of Option B wording is policy-only. |

### Tier 1 Progress Summary

| DEL-ID | Title | Work done | Remaining |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| DEL-05-01 | Instruction Root Bundling | Runtime implementation is verified; REQ-04 integrity automation is wired into packaging; REQ-02/REQ-07 residual rulings are closed; PASS8 verification (`test/typecheck/build/pack/dist`) passed; human issuance approval was applied in PASS9; lifecycle is now `ISSUED`. | Baseline scope closed. Optional hardening/policy follow-up remains (`TBD-S04`, `TBD-S05`) only if activated. |
| DEL-05-02 | Execution Root Scaffolding | Implementation + fan-in + follow-through passes are complete: sanitize/scaffolding modules, `POST /api/harness/scaffold`, typed scaffold client contracts, PIPELINE PREP scaffold trigger wiring, PREPARATION compatibility validation payloads, REQ-12 fail-fast diagnostics, PASS6 documentation-rulings harmonization, and PASS10 continuity/decision follow-through (`CON-03` baseline boundary resolved with decision record evidence). | Remaining follow-up is policy/ownership only (`B-001` responsible-party assignment). |
| DEL-06-01 | Agent Instruction Conformance | REQ-05 closure (`## Precedence` coverage across all 26 agent instructions) and WRITE_SCOPE canonical-set conflict resolution are complete; CHECKING audit passed with no exceptions and lifecycle advanced to `ISSUED` (`Conformance_Audit_Report_2026-02-23.md`). | No blocking structural work remains; optional policy-only follow-up on CT-001 modality harmonization can run separately. |
| DEL-07-02 | Example Execution Roots | Example fixture baseline remains conformant at `examples/example-project/` (1 pkg, 3 dels, 3 lifecycle states). Runtime-backed REQ-10 validation rerun passed (`HARNESS_PREMERGE_STATUS=pass`, `HARNESS_PREMERGE_TEST_COUNT=7`) and deliverable advanced to `ISSUED`. | No remaining baseline-scope work; monitor non-blocking cold-start interrupt flake under DEL-07-01/DEL-03-01 hardening scope. |

## Active Human Rulings and Assumptions

1. Blocker maturity threshold is `IN_PROGRESS`.
2. Execution sequencing uses blocker-subset filtering from `_COORDINATION.md`; full graph remains audit/reconciliation truth.
3. PKG-08 (`DEL-08-*`) stays traceable but non-driving until SOW-032..038 are explicitly ruled `IN`.
4. TASK dispatch is globally pre-authorized; no per-task human approval gate.
5. TASK execution is one deliverable per session; each session closes after bounded completion and new sessions are booted for queued work.
6. Execution and implementation edits are scoped to this repository only (`/Users/ryan/ai-env/projects/chirality-app-dev`) unless explicitly re-ruled by a human.
7. Scope Amendment A1 pre-tier gate is authoritative: `DEL-01-03`, `DEL-02-05`, `DEL-03-07`, `DEL-07-03` must reach `IN_PROGRESS` before Tier 2 code-bearing execution resumes.
8. Working-memory authority is deliverable-local only: use `execution/PKG-*/1_Working/DEL-*/MEMORY.md` as the sole memory record; do not use agent/profile memory as project-state authority.
9. `_MEMORY.md` is disabled for this project profile; if encountered in legacy state, migrate needed content into `MEMORY.md` and remove `_MEMORY.md`.
10. DEL-07-02 ruling: baseline example-root count is fixed at 1 (`examples/example-project/`) unless re-ruled.
11. DEL-07-02 ruling: `Dependencies.csv` samples are OUT for current baseline scope unless re-ruled.
12. DEL-06-02 CT-002 aggregate acceptance gate is resolved for this cycle (2026-02-23): Option B accepted and recorded in `execution/PKG-06_Agent_Suite_Governance/1_Working/DEL-06-02_Local_Deliverable_Workflow_Agents/CT-002_Acceptance_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-23.md`.
13. DEL-03-05 ruling (2026-02-23): OI-001 is resolved to `ENV_ONLY`; API key provisioning baseline is process-environment only for current scope.
14. DEL-03-05 ruling (2026-02-23): provider completion path is `ADOPT_SDK_NOW`; direct HTTP provider paths are interim-only and not sufficient for DEL-03-05 completion.
15. DEL-03-05 implementation constraint update (2026-02-23): prior docs-only deferral is now cleared by PASS3 SDK implementation; retain env-only key + SDK-first policy as active contract.
16. DEL-03-05 alias-policy follow-through (2026-02-23 PASS4): retain compatibility alias `CHIRALITY_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as fallback only; canonical `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` remains precedence source when both are set.
17. DEL-05-02 CON-03 baseline boundary ruling (2026-02-23): DEL-05-02 retains test-level conformance coverage; DEL-08-03 remains deferred while `SOW-034` is `TBD` and PKG-08 is non-driving.
18. DEL-03-05 coverage-saturation ruling (2026-02-23): unsupported image-subtype follow-through is frozen at PASS35 under representative invariant coverage; further subtype-by-subtype additions require runtime/contract change or explicit human re-ruling.
19. DEL-03-06 OI-002 ruling (2026-02-23): Option B layered enforcement + repeatable proof standard is selected for active execution (provider base-URL guardrails + Electron egress allowlist interception + telemetry/update disable posture + 3-run capture verification model).
20. DEL-03-06 CONF-002 disposition ruling (2026-02-24): Option B approved and recorded in `CONF-002_Disposition_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md`; bounded infrastructure TLS exception is now the active REQ-NET-001 interpretation.
21. DEL-03-06 lifecycle ruling (2026-02-24): `IN_PROGRESS -> CHECKING` approved and applied; transition recorded in `execution/PKG-03_Harness_Runtime_Core/1_Working/DEL-03-06_Outbound_Network_Guardrails/_STATUS.md` and `CHECKING_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md`.
22. DEL-03-06 CHECKING residual closure (2026-02-24 PASS8): `REQ-NET-004` and `REQ-NET-005a` documentation residuals plus SDK external-reference capture are now closed in `REQ-NET-004_005a_SDK_REFERENCE_CLOSURE_2026-02-24.md`; next gate focus is `CHECKING -> ISSUED` packet preparation.
23. DEL-03-06 issuance gate prep (2026-02-24 PASS9): `ISSUED_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md` is drafted and pending explicit human ruling for `CHECKING -> ISSUED`.

## Core Development Tiers (Execution Queue View)

1. **Pre-Tier Wave 0a:** `DEL-01-03` — `IN_PROGRESS`; implementation and verification evidence captured.
2. **Pre-Tier Wave 0b:** `DEL-03-07` — `IN_PROGRESS`; route surface + contract tests implemented; output-mode conflict resolved.
3. **Pre-Tier Wave 0c:** `DEL-02-05`, `DEL-07-03` — `IN_PROGRESS`; implementation and verification evidence captured; pre-tier gate satisfied.
4. **Tier 1 (active):** `DEL-05-02`.
5. **Tier 1 (checking):** none currently.
6. **Tier 1 (issued):** `DEL-05-01`, `DEL-06-01`, `DEL-07-02`.
7. **Tier 2 (code-bearing; unpaused):** `DEL-01-01`, `DEL-01-02`, `DEL-03-01`, `DEL-05-03`, `DEL-05-04`.
8. **Tier 2 (independent):** `DEL-06-02` (`ISSUED`; CT-002 Option B ruling applied).
9. **Tier 3 (active/checking):** `DEL-03-03` (`IN_PROGRESS`) and `DEL-03-06` (`CHECKING`; PASS7 approvals applied: CONF-002 Option B ratified and lifecycle advanced from `IN_PROGRESS` on 2026-02-24; PASS8 closed CHECKING residuals for `REQ-NET-004`, `REQ-NET-005a`, and SDK external-reference capture; PASS9 drafted issuance packet `ISSUED_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md` and queued explicit human `CHECKING -> ISSUED` decision).
10. **Tier 5 (active):** `DEL-03-05` (`IN_PROGRESS`; PASS35 expanded unsupported additional high-efficiency standard image-subtype coverage (`image/heif`) and a 2026-02-23 coverage-saturation ruling now freezes subtype-by-subtype expansion at representative unsupported invariants, on top of PASS34 unsupported additional further supplementary standard image-subtype coverage (`image/jph`), PASS32 unsupported further supplementary standard image-subtype coverage (`image/jpm`), PASS31 unsupported additional supplementary standard image-subtype coverage (`image/jpx`), PASS30 unsupported supplementary standard image-subtype coverage (`image/jp2`), PASS29 unsupported additional standard image-subtype coverage (`image/tiff`), PASS28 unsupported additional alternative standard image-subtype coverage (`image/jxl`), PASS27 unsupported alternative standard image-subtype coverage (`image/avif`), PASS26 unsupported standard image-subtype coverage (`image/heic`), PASS25 unsupported personal-tree image-subtype coverage (`image/prs.btif`), PASS24 unsupported dotted vendor-tree image-subtype coverage (`image/vnd.microsoft.icon`), PASS23 unsupported vendor-tree image-subtype coverage (`image/x-png`), PASS22 unsupported image-alias subtype coverage (`image/jpg`), PASS21 structured-suffix subtype fallback coverage (`image/svg+xml`), PASS20 unsupported-image-subtype authority hardening (`image/bmp`), PASS19 wildcard-token subtype fallback coverage (`image/*`), PASS18 valid `type/subtype` authority hardening for malformed `image/` tokens, PASS17 missing-token extension outcomes (`.WeBp` and `.bin`), PASS16 malformed-token fallback coverage, PASS15 exact 5 MiB threshold and parameterized non-image MIME authority assertions, plus PASS14 attachment-failure boundaries and PASS13..PASS9 hardening; forward resolver-integrated expansion remains gated by DEL-04-01 maturity).
11. **Tier 3+:** follow `execution_path_summary.json`/`Execution_Path_Blocker_Analysis.md` after gate completion.

## Sequential Workstrings (No Parallelism)

Use `execution/_Coordination/SEQUENTIAL_WORKSTRINGS_2026-02-23.md` as the active no-parallelism throughput plan. Workstring order for current baseline scope:

1. `WS-1` Frontend/Harness Foundation.
2. `WS-2` Execution-Root Contract Chain.
3. `WS-3` Runtime/Provider Hardening Chain.
4. `WS-4` Attachments + Validation Chain.
5. `WS-5` Desktop UI Completion Chain.
6. `WS-6` Governance Operationalization Chain.
7. `WS-7` Optional Hardening Chain only if `PKG-08` is explicitly ruled `IN`.

## Immediate Next Actions

1. **Keep WS-2 in monitor mode**: rerun `DEL-05-03`/`DEL-05-04` fan-in only if new lifecycle/dependency contract consumers are introduced.
2. **Treat unsupported image-subtype boundary expansion as coverage-saturated at PASS35** and continue DEL-03-05 follow-through by keeping representative unsupported invariants green while prioritizing resolver-integrated DEL-04-01 interface behavior as maturity advances.
3. **Obtain DEL-03-06 human issuance ruling**: review `ISSUED_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md` and either approve `CHECKING -> ISSUED` or return explicit gate conditions for further follow-through.
4. **Schedule the subsequent periodic full-scope closure rerun** after the next substantive Tier 1/Tier 2/Tier 3 merge point.
5. **Advance Tier 2 follow-through only as new transition consumers appear**, reusing `canAgentTransitionLifecycle`, `nextLifecycleTargets`, and `requiresApprovalShaForTarget` to keep policy consistent.
6. **Revisit alias retirement only at issuance hardening**, if canonical-only enforcement is explicitly ruled and migration impact is accepted.

## Handoff Payload (What Carries to Next Session)

1. Stable invariant instructions: `execution/_Coordination/NEXT_INSTANCE_PROMPT.md`.
2. Mutable state and queue: this file (`execution/_Coordination/NEXT_INSTANCE_STATE.md`).
3. Sequential workstring controller (no-parallelism mode): `execution/_Coordination/SEQUENTIAL_WORKSTRINGS_2026-02-23.md`.
4. Evidence pointers: latest closure and execution-path artifacts under `execution/_Reconciliation/DepClosure/CLOSURE_AUDIT_DEP_CLOSURE_2026-02-23_0804/`.
5. Deliverable-local continuity: `MEMORY.md` and `_STATUS.md` under each `execution/PKG-*/1_Working/DEL-*/` folder (`_MEMORY.md` disabled in this project profile).
6. Scope-control record: `execution/_ScopeChange/_LATEST.md` and `execution/_ScopeChange/SCA-001_2026-02-22_0720/`.
7. Tier 3 PASS7/PASS8/PASS9 DEL-03-06 gate/closure artifacts: `execution/PKG-03_Harness_Runtime_Core/1_Working/DEL-03-06_Outbound_Network_Guardrails/CONF-002_Disposition_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md`, `execution/PKG-03_Harness_Runtime_Core/1_Working/DEL-03-06_Outbound_Network_Guardrails/CHECKING_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md`, `execution/PKG-03_Harness_Runtime_Core/1_Working/DEL-03-06_Outbound_Network_Guardrails/REQ-NET-004_005a_SDK_REFERENCE_CLOSURE_2026-02-24.md`, `execution/PKG-03_Harness_Runtime_Core/1_Working/DEL-03-06_Outbound_Network_Guardrails/ISSUED_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md`, and `execution/_Coordination/TIER3_CONTROL_LOOP_2026-02-24_PASS9.md`.

## Update Protocol

1. Update `Last Updated` date/context.
2. Update snapshot pointers to latest closure outputs.
3. Update `Current Program State` and `Immediate Next Actions`.
4. Keep history/evidence in reconciliation snapshots and control-loop reports; avoid duplicating long evidence blocks here.
