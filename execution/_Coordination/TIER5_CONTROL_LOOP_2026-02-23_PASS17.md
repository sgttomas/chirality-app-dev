# Tier 5 Control Loop Report — 2026-02-23 (Pass 17 DEL-03-05 Missing-MIME Token Extension Boundary)

## Scope

- Control policy: blocker-subset sequencing from `execution/_Coordination/_COORDINATION.md`
- Strategic context: `docs/PLAN.md` (roadmap guidance only)
- Closure baseline pointer: `execution/_Reconciliation/DepClosure/_LATEST.md` -> `CLOSURE_AUDIT_DEP_CLOSURE_2026-02-23_0804`
- Session objective: continue DEL-03-05 multimodal follow-through with additional malformed resolver-MIME token fallback boundary assertions
- Touched deliverables this pass:
  - `DEL-03-05`

## 1) ORCHESTRATOR Scan — Topology and Policy Overlay

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| Full graph closure health (latest known) | `BLOCKER` (3 SCCs, 28 nodes) |
| Blocker-subset topology (latest known) | Acyclic (0 SCCs) |
| Tier 5 pass target set | `DEL-03-05` |
| Control-loop intent | Expand malformed-token fallback coverage to include additional extension outcomes (`.webp` image mapping and unknown-extension text fallback) |

Execution sequencing truth remains blocker-subset topology with maturity threshold `IN_PROGRESS`; full graph remains audit truth.

## 2) Work Executed This Pass

- Expanded provider regression coverage in:
  - `frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts`
- Added fixture-level tests that verify:
  - resolver-provided MIME metadata with no media-type token (`; charset=binary`) still falls back to extension-derived image classification for mixed-case `.WeBp` (`image/webp`)
  - resolver-provided MIME metadata with no media-type token and non-image extension (`.bin`) remains explicit text fallback (no accidental image mapping)
- No runtime code changes were required; this pass is fixture-boundary coverage hardening.

## 3) Fan-In Check Status

### DEPENDENCIES (touched deliverables)

- No dependency row add/retire/reclassify updates were required in this pass.
- DEL-03-05 prerequisite posture remains unchanged:
  - `DEP-03-05-008` (`OI-001`) = `SATISFIED`
  - `DEP-03-05-010` (`ANTHROPIC-SDK`) = `SATISFIED`

### RECONCILIATION (touched interfaces)

- Reconciliation refresh completed:
  - `execution/_Reconciliation/TIER5_INTERFACE_RECON_2026-02-23_PASS17.md`

### AUDIT_DEP_CLOSURE cadence

- No full-scope closure rerun in this pass.
- Latest full-scope closure pointer remains:
  - `execution/_Reconciliation/DepClosure/CLOSURE_AUDIT_DEP_CLOSURE_2026-02-23_0804/`

## 4) Verification Evidence

- Focused provider verification in `frontend/`:
  - `npm test -- src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts` -> PASS (`38` tests)
- Full frontend verification in `frontend/`:
  - `npm test` -> PASS (`131` tests)
  - `npm run typecheck` -> PASS
  - `npm run build` -> PASS

## 5) Current Blockers and Risks

| Risk ID | Description | Impacted deliverables | Current posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-T5-03 | Advanced multimodal coverage still depends on DEL-04-01 attachment-resolver maturity for resolver-integrated behavior beyond fixture-level contract tests | DEL-03-05, DEL-04-01 | MITIGATED (fixture-level provider boundary coverage expanded through PASS17) |
| R-T5-15 | Missing media-type token metadata could regress extension fallback behavior for less common image formats or unknown extensions | DEL-03-05 | CLOSED (PASS17 explicitly covers `.webp` normalization and unknown-extension text fallback under malformed-token input) |

## 6) Next Queue

1. Continue DEL-03-05 multimodal follow-through coverage as DEL-04-01 advances from fixture-level to resolver-integrated execution paths.
2. Schedule the next periodic full-scope closure rerun at the next substantive Tier merge point.
3. Keep Tier 2 transition-consumer follow-through scoped to newly introduced lifecycle-capable surfaces using shared helper contracts.
4. Revisit alias retirement only at issuance hardening if canonical-only enforcement is explicitly ruled and migration impact is accepted.
