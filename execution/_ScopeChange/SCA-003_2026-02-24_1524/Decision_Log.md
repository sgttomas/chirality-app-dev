# Decision Log — SCA-003

| Gate | Decision | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Gate 1 (Intake/Validation) | APPROVED | Prior session validation captured in `NEXT_INSTANCE_STATE.md`; human request parsed into SCA-003 actions. |
| Gate 2 (Impact Assessment) | APPROVED | Executed under standing startup directive to proceed with control-plane queue. |
| Gate 3 (Amendment Approval) | APPROVED | Executed under standing startup directive; decomposition amendment text applied exactly to scoped entities. |
| Gate 4 (Propagation Plan Approval) | APPROVED | Executed under standing startup directive; propagation limited to approved files and scopes. |
| Gate 5 (Execute/Validate) | APPROVED | SCA-003 artifacts written; decomposition + metadata + dependency propagation completed and validated. |

## Notes

- Stable IDs preserved (new IDs: `SOW-050`, `DEL-02-06`; no reuse).
- No folders/files were deleted.
- `_MEMORY.md` remained disabled; deliverable memory uses `MEMORY.md`.
