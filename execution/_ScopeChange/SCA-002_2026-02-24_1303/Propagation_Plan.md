# Propagation Plan — SCA-002

## Approved Decomposition Propagation
- Applied decomposition Change Log update for SCA-002.
- Applied scope-ledger flips for `SOW-032..038`.
- Applied PKG-08 lifecycle alignment in deliverable-local `_STATUS.md` files.
- Updated coordination handoff state to reflect final PKG-08 IN/OUT resolution.

## Lifecycle Propagation
- Active and issued: `DEL-08-01`, `DEL-08-02`.
- Retired: `DEL-08-03`, `DEL-08-04`, `DEL-08-05`, `DEL-08-06`, `DEL-08-07`.

## Downstream Advisory (post-amendment)
1. Keep `DEL-08-01/08-02` tooling maintained under normal validation cadence.
2. Exclude retired PKG-08 deliverables from active-front planning unless re-scoped by future amendment.
