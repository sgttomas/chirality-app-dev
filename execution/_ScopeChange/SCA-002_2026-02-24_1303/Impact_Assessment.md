# Impact Assessment — SCA-002

## Summary
This amendment is disposition-only (`TBD -> IN/OUT`) for existing PKG-08 scope items. No package or deliverable IDs were added or removed.

## Impact Table
| Action | Directly affected files | Downstream impact | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flip `SOW-032/033` to `IN` | Decomposition scope ledger + PKG-08 deliverable statuses | DEL-08-01/08-02 remain active implementation scope | Low |
| Flip `SOW-034..038` to `OUT` | Decomposition scope ledger + PKG-08 deliverable statuses | DEL-08-03..08-07 moved to `RETIRED` and removed from active queue | Low |

## Dependency/Estimate/Schedule Impact
- Dependency orphan risk: LOW (entity set unchanged; scope disposition clarified).
- Execution sequencing impact: LOW (blocker-subset topology unchanged).
- Closure impact: POSITIVE (reduces active optional backlog ambiguity).
