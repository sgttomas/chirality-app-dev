# Propagation Plan — SCA-001

## Approved Decomposition Propagation
- Applied decomposition amendment section and Change Log entry for SCA-001.
- Applied coordination gating update in NEXT_INSTANCE_STATE to enforce pre-tier frontend baseline gate.
- Applied strategic roadmap update in docs/PLAN.md to convert frontend from assumed tooling to explicit phased build program.

## ADD Action Handoff (PREPARATION via ORCHESTRATOR)
For each new deliverable below, PREPARATION should create folder + minimum metadata files:
- DEL-01-03 under PKG-01
- DEL-02-05 under PKG-02
- DEL-03-07 under PKG-03
- DEL-07-03 under PKG-07

Expected metadata files per folder:
- _CONTEXT.md
- _STATUS.md (OPEN)
- _REFERENCES.md
- _DEPENDENCIES.md

## Downstream Advisory (not executed here)
1. Run PREPARATION for the four new deliverables.
2. Run 4_DOCUMENTS (P1/P2) to initialize production docs.
3. Run ORCHESTRATOR blocker scan and confirm Tier-2 unblocking criteria.
4. Run DEPENDENCIES extraction after initial artifacts exist.
