File: execution/PKG-06_Agent_Suite_Governance/1_Working/DEL-06-01_Agent_Instruction_Conformance/Dependencies.csv","Review whether DEL-06-01 should declare cross-deliverable dependencies (e.g. to DEL-06-05 or DEL-06-02). If isolation is intentional for this governance task, accept as informational. Otherwise, rerun DEPENDENCIES extraction to capture missing deliverable-to-deliverable edges."
