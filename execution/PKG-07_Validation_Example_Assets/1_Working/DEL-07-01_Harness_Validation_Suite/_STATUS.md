## History

| Date | From | To | Agent/Actor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-21 | — | OPEN | ORCHESTRATOR/PREPARATION | Workspace scaffolding |
| 2026-02-21 | OPEN | INITIALIZED | 4_DOCUMENTS | 4_DOCUMENTS Pass 1+2 complete |
| 2026-02-21 | INITIALIZED | SEMANTIC_READY | CHIRALITY_FRAMEWORK | _SEMANTIC.md generated (semantic matrices A-E) |
| 2026-02-24 | SEMANTIC_READY | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS | Added harness validation docs + requirement traceability and expanded targeted frontend harness utility tests supporting local/CI validation posture. |
| 2026-02-24 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS | Ran live premerge validator twice with pass results, refreshed stable summary artifact, and updated section8 validator root-staging behavior to satisfy working-root conflict policy. |
| 2026-02-24 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS | Re-ran live premerge validator twice after toolkit persistence hardening (both pass) and refreshed DEL-07-01 dependency timestamps with no row/status deltas. |
| 2026-02-24 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS | Reassessed `IN_PROGRESS -> CHECKING` readiness after DEL-04-02 storage-resilience pass; retained IN_PROGRESS pending explicit CI workflow codification ruling (current posture remains docs + local premerge evidence). |
| 2026-02-24 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | HUMAN + WORKING_ITEMS | CI codification ruling resolved as `docs-only`; lifecycle promotion now depends on final acceptance decision rather than workflow-file codification. |
| 2026-02-24 | IN_PROGRESS | CHECKING | WORKING_ITEMS | Promoted to CHECKING after acceptance-readiness review: docs-only CI ruling in force, repeatable premerge pass evidence recorded, and REQ traceability/docs artifacts present. |
| 2026-02-24 | CHECKING | ISSUED | HUMAN + WORKING_ITEMS | Promoted to ISSUED on explicit human request after CHECKING review cycle. |
