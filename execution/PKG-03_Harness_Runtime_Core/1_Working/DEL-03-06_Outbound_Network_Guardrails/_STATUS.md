## History

| Date | From | To | Agent/Actor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-24 | CHECKING | CHECKING | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | PASS9 issuance-gate preparation follow-through: drafted `ISSUED_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md` for human `CHECKING -> ISSUED` review and synchronized continuity pointers in `_REFERENCES.md`, `Datasheet.md`, `Procedure.md`, and `MEMORY.md`. No lifecycle mutation applied in this pass. |
| 2026-02-24 | CHECKING | CHECKING | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | PASS8 CHECKING residual-closure follow-through: added `REQ-NET-004_005a_SDK_REFERENCE_CLOSURE_2026-02-24.md`, updated DEL-03-06 continuity docs to close `REQ-NET-004` and `REQ-NET-005a` documentation residuals, and completed SDK external-reference capture in `_REFERENCES.md` / `Datasheet.md` / `Specification.md` / `Guidance.md` / `Procedure.md`. Lifecycle remains `CHECKING`; no human gate mutation executed in this pass. |
| 2026-02-24 | IN_PROGRESS | CHECKING | HUMAN/WORKING_ITEMS | Human approvals applied in-session: "Approve CONF-002 Option B disposition text." and "Approve IN_PROGRESS -> CHECKING for DEL-03-06." Lifecycle advanced per `docs/SPEC.md` Section 3.3 with gate evidence in `CHECKING_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md`; CONF-002 disposition record finalized in `CONF-002_Disposition_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md`. |
| 2026-02-24 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | PASS7 gate-prep follow-through: drafted CONF-002 disposition decision input (`CONF-002_Disposition_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md`) with concrete bounded TLS infrastructure carve-out wording and drafted lifecycle transition packet (`CHECKING_Gate_Decision_Input_2026-02-24.md`) for potential `IN_PROGRESS -> CHECKING` movement. Draft state was superseded by same-day human approval and transition row above. |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 3 PASS6 proof-standard follow-through completed for OI-002 Option B: added opt-in renderer network probe execution hook in `frontend/electron/main.ts`; added repeatable proof harness script `frontend/scripts/run-network-policy-proof.mjs` and package script `proof:network-policy`; executed 3 independent runtime captures (startup/session boot/turn/10-minute idle/shutdown) with aggregate `PASS` under `execution/PKG-03_Harness_Runtime_Core/1_Working/DEL-03-06_Outbound_Network_Guardrails/Evidence/OI-002_PROOF_OPTIONB_2026-02-23_PASS6/`; recorded final report `OI-002_OptionB_Proof_Report_2026-02-23.md`; refreshed DEL-03-06 docs/continuity and Tier 3 PASS6 control/reconciliation evidence. Verification: `npm test -- src/__tests__/scripts/build-network-policy.test.ts` PASS (3), `npm run build` PASS, `npm run typecheck` PASS (sequential rerun after `.next/types` generation). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 3 PASS5 follow-through landed: applied OI-002 Option B ruling outcome and started enforcement-path execution by adding renderer egress allowlist interception in `frontend/electron/main.ts` (`session.webRequest.onBeforeRequest`) with explicit Anthropic + loopback allowlist and fail-closed diagnostics (`REQ-NET-001`). Added regression guardrail coverage in `frontend/src/__tests__/scripts/build-network-policy.test.ts` for interception/policy primitives. Updated DEL-03-06 decision/specification/procedure/datasheet/guidance artifacts to reflect resolved OI-002 posture and active proof standard. Re-verified frontend (`npm test -- src/__tests__/scripts/build-network-policy.test.ts`=3, `npm test`=176, `npm run build` PASS, `npm run typecheck` PASS via sequential rerun after known parallel `.next/types` race). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 3 PASS4 follow-through landed: expanded DEL-03-06 outbound base-URL guardrail regression coverage in `frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts` for embedded-credential rejection, non-default HTTPS port rejection, and explicit default-port (`:443`) acceptance normalization. Prepared OI-002 decision packet artifact (`OI-002_Enforcement_Proof_Decision_Input_2026-02-23.md`) with concrete enforcement/proof options and recommended layered posture. Updated DEL-03-06 procedure record path to project-profile canonical `MEMORY.md` + decision artifact (no `_MEMORY.md`). Re-verified frontend (`npm test -- src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts`=58, `npm test`=155, `npm run build` PASS, `npm run typecheck` PASS via sequential rerun after known parallel `.next/types` race). |
| 2026-02-23 | SEMANTIC_READY | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Baseline DEL-03-06 implementation pass landed: enforced fail-closed Anthropic outbound host/protocol guardrails in `frontend/src/lib/harness/anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.ts` for `CHIRALITY_ANTHROPIC_API_URL` (`https` only, explicit allowlist `api.anthropic.com`, no credentials, no non-default ports). Added regression coverage in `frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts` for non-allowlisted host, non-HTTPS scheme, and malformed base URL rejection (`SDK_FAILURE` with typed network-policy details). Verification in `frontend/`: `npm test -- src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts`=55, `npm test`=152, `npm run build` PASS, `npm run typecheck` PASS. |
