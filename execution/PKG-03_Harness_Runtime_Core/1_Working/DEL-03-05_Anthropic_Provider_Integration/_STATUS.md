## History

| Date | From | To | Agent/Actor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 5 PASS9 follow-through landed: hardened provider MIME normalization by stripping MIME parameters before classification/formatting and hardened REQ-09 redaction flow to single-pass longest-key-first replacement for overlapping canonical/alias keys in `frontend/src/lib/harness/anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.ts`. Added regression coverage for parameterized MIME resolver metadata and overlapping-key redaction boundaries in `frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts` (now 19 tests). Re-verified frontend (`npm test`=112, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` all PASS). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 5 PASS8 follow-through landed: hardened provider REQ-09 error-surface handling by redacting configured API-key material from SDK-status failures, stream error-event messages, and network error detail payloads in `frontend/src/lib/harness/anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.ts`. Added regression coverage for SDK/stream/network redaction boundaries in `frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts` (now 16 tests). Re-verified frontend (`npm test`=109, `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck` all PASS; `typecheck` passed after sequential rerun following known `.next/types` race when run concurrently with build). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 5 PASS7 follow-through landed: hardened resolver MIME-authority normalization in provider formatting path (trim + lowercase before classification) and expanded fixture-boundary coverage. New tests verify resolver-provided `Image/PNG` with non-canonical casing/spacing remains image-mapped and uppercase `APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM` still triggers extension fallback for image-like filenames (`frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts`, now 13 tests). Re-verified frontend (`npm test`=106, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` all PASS). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 5 PASS6 follow-through landed: added inverse MIME-authority boundary coverage for DEL-04-01-style resolver fixtures. New provider regression test verifies resolver-provided non-image MIME (`application/pdf`) remains authoritative even when filename extension is image-like (`.png`), preserving explicit fallback-text formatting in Anthropic request payloads (`frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts`, now 11 tests). Re-verified frontend (`npm test`=104, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` all PASS). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 5 PASS5 follow-through landed: expanded DEL-03-05 provider boundary coverage for DEL-04-01-style resolver fixtures. Added tests verifying resolver-provided image MIME takes precedence even with non-image extension and warning-text/document-fallback ordering is preserved in Anthropic request content (`frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts`, now 10 tests). Re-verified frontend (`npm test`=103, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` all PASS). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 5 PASS4 follow-through landed: expanded DEL-03-05 provider coverage for multimodal formatting boundaries and alias policy behavior. Added tests for image block base64 formatting, non-image fallback text mapping, compatibility alias fallback usage, and canonical key precedence when both env keys are set (`frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts`, now 8 tests). Re-verified frontend (`npm test`=101, `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck` all PASS). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 5 PASS3 SDK implementation landed: replaced manual HTTP/SSE provider path with `@anthropic-ai/sdk` client streaming, pinned `@anthropic-ai/sdk@0.78.0`, normalized `CHIRALITY_ANTHROPIC_API_URL` to SDK `baseURL`, enforced default `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` (env override supported), and preserved typed harness error taxonomy + interruption semantics. Updated focused provider tests for SDK-path assertions and re-verified frontend (`npm test`=97, focused provider tests=6, `npm run typecheck` pass after sequential rerun, `npm run build` pass). Dependency closure updated (`DEP-03-05-010` SATISFIED). |
| 2026-02-23 | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Documentation-only policy-closure pass applied: OI-001 resolved as `ENV_ONLY`; provider path ruled `ADOPT_SDK_NOW`; DEL-03-05 docs/scope aligned for implementation handoff. Added ruling artifact `POLICY_RULING_OI-001_PROVIDER_2026-02-23.md`, updated Datasheet/Specification/Guidance/Procedure, refreshed dependency posture (`DEP-03-05-008` SATISFIED; `DEP-03-05-010` remains PENDING), and wrote Tier 5 PASS2 control/reconciliation evidence. No additional implementation was performed in this pass. |
| 2026-02-23 | SEMANTIC_READY | IN_PROGRESS | WORKING_ITEMS/TASK | Tier 5 implementation pass landed in `frontend/`: added Anthropic provider-mode runtime manager with typed key/error handling, SSE delta translation, timeout/interrupt handling, and multimodal image block formatting fallback; provider selection is explicit via `CHIRALITY_HARNESS_PROVIDER=anthropic` while default stub mode remains deterministic for validation baselines. Added regression coverage in `src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts` and `src/__tests__/lib/harness-runtime.test.ts`. Verification in `frontend/`: `npm test -- src/__tests__/lib/harness-runtime.test.ts src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts` (5 tests), `npm test` (96 tests), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` all passed. |
