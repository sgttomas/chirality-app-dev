# Working Memory — DEL-03-05

*This file is shared working memory for WORKING_ITEMS and TASK agents operating on this deliverable.*

## Key Decisions

- Introduced an explicit provider-mode switch in runtime bootstrap:
  - `CHIRALITY_HARNESS_PROVIDER=anthropic` -> use Anthropic-backed manager.
  - unset/other values -> keep deterministic stub manager.
- Kept stub mode as default to preserve section8/premerge deterministic validation behavior while DEL-03-05 matures.
- Human ruling applied (2026-02-23):
  - `OI-001 = ENV_ONLY`
  - provider implementation path = `ADOPT_SDK_NOW`
- SDK-path implementation landed in current cycle:
  - `@anthropic-ai/sdk` pinned to `0.78.0`
  - default `anthropic-version` header baseline set to `2023-06-01` (env override supported)
- Key provisioning contract for current scope is environment-only (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, optional compatibility alias `CHIRALITY_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) with no persisted secure-storage mechanism.
- Alias policy follow-through (2026-02-23): retain compatibility alias fallback for migration, but enforce canonical-precedence (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` wins when both keys are set).
- PASS5 fixture-boundary expansion (2026-02-23): provider tests now explicitly cover DEL-04-01-style fixture boundaries, including resolver-provided MIME precedence and warning/document fallback ordering.
- PASS6 fixture-boundary expansion (2026-02-23): provider tests now cover inverse MIME-authority behavior, confirming resolver-provided non-image MIME remains authoritative even when file extension is image-like.
- PASS7 fixture-boundary expansion (2026-02-23): provider now normalizes resolver MIME metadata (case/spacing) before classification; coverage verifies non-canonical resolver image MIME remains authoritative and uppercase `application/octet-stream` still routes through extension fallback.
- PASS8 error-surface hardening (2026-02-23): provider now redacts configured API-key material from surfaced SDK failure messages, stream error events, and network error detail payloads to enforce REQ-09 log/error protection boundaries.
- PASS9 fixture/error-surface hardening (2026-02-23): provider now strips MIME parameters before classification (for example `image/png; charset=binary`) and uses one longest-key-first redaction pass to prevent overlap-driven key-suffix leakage artifacts in surfaced errors.
- PASS10 error-surface hardening (2026-02-23): provider now includes URL-encoded configured key variants in the redaction candidate set (including `+`-encoded spaces) so encoded key material cannot leak through SDK/stream/network surfaced errors.
- PASS11 error-surface hardening (2026-02-23): provider now includes lowercase percent-encoded URL key variants in the redaction candidate set so lowercase-encoded key material cannot leak through SDK/stream/network surfaced errors.
- PASS12 error-surface hardening (2026-02-23): provider now includes double URL-encoded key variants in the redaction candidate set (including lowercase percent-encoding and query-style `+` space forms) so doubly encoded key material cannot leak through SDK/stream/network surfaced errors.
- PASS13 error-surface hardening (2026-02-23): provider now propagates query-style `+` space variants through subsequent encoding rounds, closing the residual double query-style URL-encoded leakage path not covered by PASS12.
- PASS14 multimodal failure-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider regression coverage now explicitly asserts typed fail-fast `ATTACHMENT_FAILURE` behavior for unreadable image paths and oversized inline images (>5 MiB), including no upstream Anthropic request dispatch on those failures.
- PASS15 multimodal boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider regression coverage now asserts inline image threshold acceptance at exactly 5 MiB and parameterized resolver-provided non-image MIME authority (`application/pdf; charset=binary`) even when attachment filename extension is image-like.
- PASS16 multimodal metadata-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider regression coverage now asserts resolver-provided MIME metadata without a media-type token (`; charset=binary`) falls back to extension classification, including mixed-case extension normalization (`.JpEg` -> `image/jpeg`) and Anthropic image block dispatch.
- PASS17 multimodal metadata-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider regression coverage now asserts malformed resolver MIME metadata without media-type token (`; charset=binary`) keeps extension fallback deterministic for mixed-case `.WeBp` -> `image/webp`, while unknown non-image extensions (`.bin`) remain explicit text fallback and do not drift into image mapping.
- PASS18 multimodal metadata-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider now requires resolver MIME metadata to be a valid `type/subtype` token before treating it as authoritative, so malformed subtype-free tokens (`image/; charset=binary`) route through deterministic extension outcomes (`.GiF` -> `image/gif`) while non-image extensions remain explicit text fallback.
- PASS19 multimodal metadata-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider regression coverage now asserts wildcard resolver MIME subtype tokens (`image/*; charset=binary`) remain non-authoritative and route through deterministic extension outcomes (`.PnG` -> `image/png`) while non-image extensions (`.bin`) remain explicit text fallback.
- PASS20 multimodal metadata-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider now treats unsupported but syntactically valid resolver image subtype tokens (for example `image/bmp`) as non-authoritative, routing through extension fallback outcomes (`.JpEg` -> `image/jpeg`) while non-image extensions (`.bin`) remain explicit text fallback.
- PASS21 multimodal metadata-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider regression coverage now asserts unsupported structured-suffix resolver image subtype tokens (`image/svg+xml; charset=binary`) remain non-authoritative and route through deterministic extension outcomes (`.WeBp` -> `image/webp`) while non-image extensions (`.bin`) remain explicit text fallback.
- PASS22 multimodal metadata-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider regression coverage now asserts unsupported resolver image alias subtype tokens (`image/jpg; charset=binary`) remain non-authoritative and route through deterministic extension outcomes (`.JpEg` -> `image/jpeg`) while non-image extensions (`.bin`) remain explicit text fallback.
- PASS23 multimodal metadata-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider regression coverage now asserts unsupported resolver vendor-tree image subtype tokens (`image/x-png; charset=binary`) remain non-authoritative and route through deterministic extension outcomes (`.WeBp` -> `image/webp`) while non-image extensions (`.bin`) remain explicit text fallback.
- PASS24 multimodal metadata-boundary follow-through (2026-02-23): provider regression coverage now asserts unsupported resolver dotted vendor-tree image subtype tokens (`image/vnd.microsoft.icon; charset=binary`) remain non-authoritative and route through deterministic extension outcomes (`.WeBp` -> `image/webp`) while non-image extensions (`.bin`) remain explicit text fallback.

  - No additional implementation was applied in this pass.
- Tier 5 implementation pass (2026-02-23) landed in:
  - `frontend/src/lib/harness/anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.ts`

  - `frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts`
  - `frontend/src/__tests__/lib/harness-runtime.test.ts`
- Provider manager behavior added:
  - server-side Anthropic SDK client initialization with baseURL/version contract wiring and typed error classification.
  - SDK stream translation to harness `chat:delta` / `chat:complete` / `process:exit` events.
  - timeout + interrupt handling via `AbortController`.
  - multimodal image block formatting (`image/*` to base64); unsupported non-image attachments degrade to explicit text notice.
  - marker compatibility retained for existing harness baseline tests (`__BOOT_SDK_FAIL__`, `TURN_SDK_FAIL_TEST`, dontAsk permission markers).
- Dependency refresh applied:
  - `DEP-03-05-005` updated to `RequiredMaturity=IN_PROGRESS`, `SatisfactionStatus=SATISFIED` (upstream DEL-03-03 now `IN_PROGRESS`).
  - `DEP-03-05-010` updated to `SatisfactionStatus=SATISFIED` (SDK prerequisite closed after implementation pin).
- Verification evidence in `frontend/`:
  - `npm test -- src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts` -> PASS (44 tests)
  - alias-policy coverage now explicit:
    - canonical absent + alias present -> alias used
    - canonical + alias both present -> canonical used
  - multimodal formatting coverage now explicit:
    - image attachment (`.png`) -> Anthropic `image` content block with base64 source
    - non-image attachment -> explicit text fallback block
    - resolver-classified image MIME with non-image extension remains image-mapped
    - resolver-classified non-image MIME with image-like extension remains fallback-text mapped

    - resolver-classified uppercase `application/octet-stream` remains extension-fallback input
    - resolver-classified parameterized image MIME (for example `image/png; charset=binary`) is normalized to canonical image media type
    - resolver-classified parameterized `application/octet-stream` remains extension-fallback input
    - resolver-provided MIME metadata with no media-type token (for example `; charset=binary`) falls back to extension-derived image classification (`.JpEg` -> `image/jpeg`)
    - resolver-provided malformed MIME subtype token (`image/; charset=binary`) is not treated as authoritative and falls back to extension-derived outcomes (`.GiF` -> `image/gif`; `.bin` -> explicit text fallback)
    - resolver-provided wildcard MIME subtype token (`image/*; charset=binary`) is treated as non-authoritative and falls back to extension-derived outcomes (`.PnG` -> `image/png`; `.bin` -> explicit text fallback)
    - resolver-provided unsupported but syntactically valid image subtype token (`image/bmp; charset=binary`) is treated as non-authoritative and falls back to extension-derived outcomes (`.JpEg` -> `image/jpeg`; `.bin` -> explicit text fallback)
    - resolver warning text and document fallback order preserved in Anthropic request content
    - unreadable resolver-provided image paths now fail with typed `ATTACHMENT_FAILURE` and no provider request dispatch
    - oversized resolver-provided images (>5 MiB inline limit) now fail with typed `ATTACHMENT_FAILURE` and no provider request dispatch
    - resolver-provided images at exactly 5 MiB are accepted and formatted into Anthropic image content blocks
    - parameterized resolver-provided non-image MIME (`application/pdf; charset=binary`) remains authoritative with explicit fallback text even when extension is image-like
    - SDK/stream/network surfaced error payloads redact configured API-key material (`[REDACTED_API_KEY]`) including overlapping canonical/alias, uppercase URL-encoded, lowercase URL-encoded, double URL-encoded, and double query-style URL-encoded key scenarios
  - `npm test -- src/__tests__/lib/harness-runtime.test.ts src/__tests__/lib/harness-anthropic-agent-sdk-manager.test.ts` -> PASS (6 tests)
  - `npm test` -> PASS (141 tests)
  - `npm run typecheck` -> PASS (sequential rerun after build due known `.next/types` race when run concurrently)
  - `npm run build` -> PASS
