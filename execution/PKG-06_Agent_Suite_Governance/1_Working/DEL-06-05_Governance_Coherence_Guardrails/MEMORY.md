# Working Memory — DEL-06-05

*This file is shared working memory for WORKING_ITEMS and TASK agents operating on this deliverable.*

## Key Decisions

- 2026-02-24: Use `Governance_Coherence_Verification_Report_2026-02-24.md` as the canonical execution record for Procedure Steps 1-11.
- 2026-02-24: Resolve CT-001 by normalizing hierarchy references to DIRECTIVE Section 5 (`Structural Constraints` -> `Flat package hierarchy`).
- 2026-02-24: Normalize lifecycle vocabulary in DEL-06-05 docs to canonical states (`IN_PROGRESS`, `CHECKING`) instead of deprecated `WORKING`.

## Open Questions

- `Responsible Party` in Datasheet remains TBD; who is the formal acceptance/sign-off owner for DEL-06-05? (A-001 lifecycle-blocker condition waived for issuance via `HW-DEL-06-05-A001-2026-02-24`.)
- Should REQ-COH-06 periodic review interval be codified globally (for example, monthly) or remain human-set per session?

## Notes

- Files updated this pass:
  - `Datasheet.md`
  - `Specification.md`
  - `Procedure.md`
  - `Guidance.md`
  - `_STATUS.md`
  - `Governance_Coherence_Verification_Report_2026-02-24.md`
