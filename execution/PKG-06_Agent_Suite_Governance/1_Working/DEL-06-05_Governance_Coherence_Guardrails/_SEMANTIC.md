# Deliverable: DEL-06-05 Governance Coherence + Guardrails (OUT boundaries)

**Generated:** 2026-02-21
**DECOMP_VARIANT:** SOFTWARE
**Perspective:** This deliverable exists to ensure that a suite of governance documents remains internally coherent across hierarchy, vocabulary, invariant, lifecycle, and state-authority dimensions, while keeping explicit out-of-scope boundaries enforced through layered mechanisms. It carries knowledge about cross-document consistency verification and multi-layered guardrail enforcement for boundaries that define what the system fundamentally must not do, preserving human authority over approval, safety-critical judgment, financial commitment, professional responsibility, and external integration.
