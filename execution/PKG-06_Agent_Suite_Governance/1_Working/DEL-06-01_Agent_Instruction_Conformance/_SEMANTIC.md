# Deliverable: DEL-06-01 Agent Instruction Suite Structural Conformance

**Generated:** 2026-02-21
**DECOMP_VARIANT:** SOFTWARE
**Perspective:** This deliverable governs the structural conformance of agent instruction files against a canonical standard, ensuring that each instruction document carries the prescribed headers, section markers, type tables, and write-scope declarations required for runtime parseability, operator navigability, and contract enforcement. The semantic lens conditions all categories and types toward the governance of document structure rather than document content.
**Framework:** Chirality Semantic Algebra
