# Working Memory — DEL-06-03

*This file is shared working memory for WORKING_ITEMS and TASK agents operating on this deliverable.*

## Key Decisions

- 2026-02-24: Use `Cross_Deliverable_Workflow_Conformance_Assessment_2026-02-24.md` as the canonical assessment record for Steps 0-9 outputs.
- 2026-02-24: Keep R-003 for SCHEDULING as `INDETERMINATE` until SPEC Section 1.2 formally includes `_Schedule/`.
- 2026-02-24: Close ASMP-001 (objective mapping) and ASMP-002 (automatic-trigger concern) based on direct source review and decomposition evidence.

## Open Questions

- Should `docs/SPEC.md` Section 1.2 add `_Schedule/` directly, or should scheduling outputs be remapped to an existing tool root?
- Does governance want a formal acceptance token format for DEL-06-03 completion beyond `_STATUS.md` history entries?

## Notes

- Files updated this pass:
  - `Datasheet.md`
  - `Procedure.md`
  - `Specification.md`
  - `_STATUS.md`
  - `Cross_Deliverable_Workflow_Conformance_Assessment_2026-02-24.md`
