# Semantic Lens: DEL-99-03 — Test Harness

## Matrix A — Orientation (Canonical)

|  | GUIDING | APPLYING | JUDGING | REVIEWING |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NORMATIVE** | test standards | test execution | pass/fail determination | coverage reporting |
| **OPERATIVE** | fixture design | harness implementation | result validation | regression tracking |
| **EVALUATIVE** | conformance criteria | check application | finding classification | audit trail |

## Matrix B — Conceptualization (Canonical)

|  | DESCRIBING | DIFFERENTIATING | COMPOSING | SEQUENCING |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NORMATIVE** | check definition | conformant vs non-conformant | test suite assembly | check ordering |
| **OPERATIVE** | fixture specification | positive vs negative cases | runner composition | execution flow |
| **EVALUATIVE** | result characterization | pass vs fail distinction | report aggregation | regression sequence |
